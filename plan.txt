Working on adding elastic collisions when asteroids collide 
with player ship in a non-fatal way. Basically, the ship's motion 
should change depending on the asteroid mass and inertia. 

A sector map has been added but is not currently used.
It's part of a planned upgrade to sector-based gameplay
instead of waves. We'll eventually get rid of the player score 
and the high score table as well.

It would be good to add component members to FPlayObject2D to avoid 
doing the subclasses' features entirely by inheritance, to have 
class dtors automatically remove widgets from the canvas.

We could have all the torpedos be drawn by a single 
Slate widget similar to how SDaylonParticles works, 
removing 20-30 widgets from the scenegraph.

There's still some duplicate code so we want patterns or function consolidation.

The player-rock collision detection seems to be a bit too generous 
in some cases.

To reduce the scenegraph, we could move various UI "screens" 
such as intro, main menu, highscores, etc. to their own UUserWidget's, 
and use CreateWidget, AddToViewport, RemoveFromViewport, etc. to 
transition between them. The performance gain is negligible, but 
it would make using the Widget Designer easier -- intead of having 
to hide the parts of the UI one isn't working on, one could 
just edit the screen of interest. It would also reduce the 
code in the transition function; instead of showing/hiding 
various parts, it would just remove the current userwidget 
and add the new one.
   The details have already been worked out for Defcon, which 
has so many screens that UUserWidget switching was mandatory.

Might be worth refactoring some widget binds and other function calls 
to use Daylon::TFastMessageMediator, to improve loose coupling. 
The current TBindableValue usage can require the event recipient to 
know about the event source.

Should make shields a component that can be used by anything, 
so once a player progresses to having lots of invincibility, 
the enemies start going after shield powerups. If they get one, 
shields appear around them. If they get another one, then they 
get ringed by two shields. 
   We could also have them go after any kind of powerup, 
even gain double-guns and temporary invincibility.
