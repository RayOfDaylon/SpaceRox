Version 1.2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXKK6ThleVQ  
Version 1.4 (powerups): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2CBQ7l-PXI  
Version 1.6.4 (nicer intro): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYPj2w0ImMY

The game departs from Asteroids as development continues, e.g.:
- Powerups such as shields and double-guns  
- Scavenger enemies that harvest unpicked powerups

Unreal Engine 5.1 or higher required.

Keyboard and gamepad input supported at present.

A 1920 x 1080 (HD) viewport is used. Monitors of different sizes and/or display scales will scale. Textures are deliberately oversized to avoid blurring when upscaled.

Game sounds may be loud. Until a volume setting is added, it's recommended to manually lower the volume in your OS speaker/headphone settings.

All graphics are done in UMG/Slate. This project was partly done to see how performant a pure UMG game could be. It was fine, but Slate is now used for all gameplay objects to be even better.

If you prefer to just download a Windows binary to play the game, one is available at https://www.daylongraphics.com/download/spacerox/SpaceRox.zip
