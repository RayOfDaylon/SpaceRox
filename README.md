# Stellar Mayhem
Remake of Atari Asteroids 1979 arcade game using Unreal Engine

"SpaceRox" is the internal project name.

An example gameplay video is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXKK6ThleVQ

Another video is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2CBQ7l-PXI

Unreal Engine 5.1 or higher required.

Keyboard and gamepad input supported at present.

A 1920 x 1080 (HD) viewport is used. Monitors of different sizes and/or display scales will scale. Textures are deliberately oversized to avoid blurring when upscaled.

Game sounds may be loud. Until a volume setting is added, it's recommended to manually lower the volume in your OS speaker/headphone settings.

All graphics are done in UMG/Slate. This project was partly done to see how performant a pure UMG game could be. It's fine, but UMG will likely be dropped to prefer Slate to gain performance.

If you prefer to just download a Windows binary to play the game, one is available at https://www.daylongraphics.com/download/spacerox/SpaceRox.zip
